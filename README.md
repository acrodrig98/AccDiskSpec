AccDiskSpec provides the foundations for modeling a Shakura-Sunyaev disk (optically thick, geometrically thin) in astrophysics. It was initially developed for the study of the most luminous protostellar disk eruptions, known as FU Orionis (FU Ori) objects. 
This is a modular code that can be adapted for a choice of stellar atmospheres, disk temperature profile, and inner disk boundary conditions. Additionally, there is a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to compare models to spectrophotometric data.

The initial paper that describes and showcases the code is [Rodriguez and Hillenbrand 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..144R/abstract), though several additions and improvements were made by A. Carvalho and L. A. Hillenbrand, among others, afterwards.
