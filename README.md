# Welcome to AccDiskSpec!
AccDiskSpec provides the foundations for modeling a Shakura-Sunyaev disk (optically thick, geometrically thin) in astrophysics. It was initially developed for the study of the most luminous protostellar disk eruptions, known as FU Orionis (FU Ori) objects. 
This is a modular code that can be adapted for a choice of stellar atmospheres, disk temperature profile, and inner disk boundary conditions. Additionally, there is a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework to compare models to spectrophotometric data.

### Statement of Need
Prior to this work, few (if any) public codes were avaiable for modeling thin disks, commonly used across astrophysics from planet formation to galaxy evolution. Also lacking were codes that took a Bayesian approach to parameter estimation from high-quality data (i.e. spectroscopy, not photometry). We created this code in order to fill that need and further our studies of FU Ori objects. 

### Publications and Citations
The initial paper that describes and showcases the code is [Rodriguez and Hillenbrand 2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...927..144R/abstract), though several additions and improvements were made by A. Carvalho and L. A. Hillenbrand, among others, afterwards. 

Please see the .pdf file at the top of the directory to begin. We encourage citation of the paper listed above, including subsequent studies by A. Carvalho and L. A. Hillenbrand if their versions are used.
